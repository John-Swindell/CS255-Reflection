### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project is essentially a simulated client project. We as students are given an interview document conducted by a systems analyst who is interviewing a CEO with an idea for a new business. The systems analyst has done their due diligence, ensuring the requirements given are both accurate and well thought out. For instance, the client is a nontechnical individual, yet the systems analyst was able to ask enough questions to very clearly outline that cloud infrastructure will be needed to meet the client's necessities. The design was a rather complex system with a number of functional, nonfunctional, security, cloud, and administrative requirements. The client wanted to create a program for students to learn how to drive in a more controlled environment and simulate the exact driving test given by the DMV. This business idea was to directly solve the problem of students often failing their driving exam.

### What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did particularly well at identifying the client's needs. I was constantly referring back to the interview document and actively mapping out how I would design the system while reading through it. I chose to do this process a few times to help develop an idea of the exact requirements. For example, the client wanted to have consistent updates from the DMV to ensure their testing environment stayed up to date. Immediately, I recognized that an API call would likely be necessary and wondered whether an agency like the DMV even had a public-facing endpoint. In the real world, this situation would be a business problem I need to solve. However, in this context, I only needed to recognize that such a problem existed. I believe that was my strongest point in this project.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Overall, I am quite happy with how my project turned out. However, if I had to choose a single document to revise, it would certainly be the presentation. I find PowerPoint presentations generally lack substance, and I would try to add more visual elements. Generally, when making presentations in a professional setting, I have found that actually writing less and talking more leads to better results. I think my speaker notes were well thought out, and I definitely kept to including non-technical language, but the slides were rather stale. This was mostly because I was given a template to use, so I stuck to what was being asked of me on the rubric, avoiding adding unnecessary changes. If I had more freedom to change things around, I would do my best to improve the presentation slides.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by thoroughly analyzing the interview document and identifying both explicit and implicit requirements. The client made it clear that the goal was to help students pass their driving test by offering a realistic, simulated environment. This included features such as DMV-aligned testing simulations, scheduling tools, study materials, and tracking progress. From these needs, I focused on designing a system that prioritized usability, accessibility, and up to date information.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to designing software begins with requirements gathering and analysis. I start by carefully reviewing all available documentation and identifying key stakeholders and their needs. In this case, I used the interview transcript to extract functional and nonfunctional requirements and created diagrams (like use case and system context diagrams) to better visualize the system's architecture and user interactions.
